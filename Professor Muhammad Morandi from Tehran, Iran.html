I am joined by Professor Muhammad Morandi joining from Tehran 
Professor Morandi thanks so much again for joining me today Thank you very much for inviting me
 Danny It's always a pleasure Well let's get right started Everybody
 hit the like button as you come on that helps boost the stream in the YouTube
 algorithm Professor Mandi my first question to you You know Iran right now is standing very defiant to Trump's war
 escalation amid all of this liberation day hype and it's not cowtowing to the
 presence of war plananes and ships that are heading its way And it's promising reciprocal blows and even the rapid
 buildup of nuclear weapons development should it be necessary Is the US and
 Israel right now Professor Rod sewing the seeds for their demise or is this catastrophic war that's to come that is
 building up going to lead to Iran's ultimate defeat uh Professor Mandi what
 is your initial impressions of this question
 you know I have fought in war since I was 16 you know as a volunteer and um I
 went and fought on and off few months every year as a volunteer until the war
 ended six years later It was an eight-year long war but the first two years I was too young to be able to
 volunteer When I was 16 I volunteered Then since I was still young I had to give a sort of exam or I was interviewed
 and and I was allowed to go and fight Um so you know if I could go to Gaza I
 would go to Gaza If I could go to Lebanon I'd go to Lebanon If I could go to Syria I'd go to Syria because if it's
 something I believe in I'd fight for And of course Yemen the same But war is horrible I mean that is there's no doubt
 about it Uh I I hate war If I have to fight a war I'll fight a war But if but
 I hate war Uh I don't want war but I
 believe that the United States would lose a war with Iran Everyone would lose I mean the
 world would lose War is horrible As I said the war in Ukraine is a loss for Russia and it's a loss for Ukraine It's
 a loss for the West but the loss for Russia is less than the West And that's why Russia's winning Relatively speaking
 Russia comes out on top uh we predicted that from the very beginning many of us
 you yourself me and some of our friends but war is still horrible and
 it's a loss for everyone so um I don't want war to happen but uh it's not
 something that the Islamic Republic of Iran is going to be fearful of it it does not want war
 but if it has to confront the United States it will confront the United states And I think we've already seen
 that Um Trump sent a letter which had an
 implicit threat The Iranians said "No we're not going to negotiate We're not going to have direct
 talks." And the Iranians said "As usual just as in the past we are prepared to
 have indirect talks," which we've always have had with Trump and with previous administrations
 Trump Uh we we've heard over the last couple of days in the media that uh the
 the Trump team or Trump they're thinking about the Iranian proposal for indirect
 negotiations Uh that's not a proposal The Iranians never proposed that Iran has said it's willing to continue
 indirect negotiations We've already been doing that So there's nothing new there But the very fact that they put it this
 way and they've said it in the media or they've said it through the media I
 think indicates that it is possible that the that Trump wants an offramp He he he
 he wants the opportunity to deescalate at least for now That may not be true or
 may be true until tonight when he tweets something new because that's how Trump works He says one thing that next day
 it's something else this whole uh tariff saga
 uh you know we've we've heard different things it's been you know with Canada the United States Mexico the United
 States it keeps changing and then suddenly and then finally today we got uh a list that that's different or the
 percentages are different from what they were it was going to be earlier and it may evolve again tomorrow so there's no
 Trump is not a very stable person he's not stable at all So if we say that he's
 seeking for an offramp that means that he may be seeking for an offramp today but not necessarily
 tomorrow But that of course is the one of the one of the reasons why Iran can't negotiate with Trump because we can we
 can't trust anything that he says If he says he'll agree to something today he
 may change his mind tomorrow Look at what happened in Gaza the day before he
 came to power He his he negotiated or his people
 negotiated the ceasefire and we were told that his representative went and
 told Netanyahu to sit down and shut up and do as we say remember it was on a
 Saturday and Netanyahu's office uh supposedly said uh that he you know
 cannot he cannot meet anyone today and and so on and he was forced to do so but
 then what happened we were told he's a man of peace he wants to end the this holocaust
 and then he said Palestinians must leave the the deal that he negotiated
 uh the deal that he is the guarantor He is saying the Palestinians must leave
 That that's that's totally against the deal And then later on he gives the
 green light to Netanyahu to restart the the mass slaughter of women and
 children So how can we negotiate with Trump so even whether you know the there
 are two there are two issues here One is can Trump defeat Iran or will Iran
 defeat the United States will the war will the world lose what will happen that's one question The second is okay
 War is tragic But how can we negotiate with this guy how can we sit down and talk
 with him when he changes his mind every day the United States does that It's not
 just him You saw for example uh the not just the
 Minsk accords but the Estanbul negotiations that could have ended the war three years ago the war in
 Ukraine who who pushed Zaninski to quit
 the talks It was the previous British prime
 minister But who was he speaking on behalf of it was the United States So
 negotiations Minsk Accords the JCPOA the United States never fulfilled
 their side of the bargain when they signed in the JCPOA under Obama It wasn't just Trump who
 tore up the deal Obama was violating the deal from day one even though Iran was fully
 committed But Trump is even worse So the question is can we even
 negotiate i think the question is the answer to that is at least for now no there's no one to
 you know there's there's no one in Washington who you can speak with and to be and you could be sure that what he
 says matters or what he says will be carried
 out but if there's war and this is where my friend Scott Ritter and I have a
 disagreement because we had a a Twitter exchange change a few days ago Some I
 think some of our friends probably read them like we had 20 10 15 20 tweets that went back and forth on two three
 different occasions Scott was saying basically that Iran should give up its sovereignty
 it sovereign right to nuclear program because uh Trump will destroy Iran
 And my response was that u first of
 all if you accept that logic then even if Iran gives up its nuclear program its
 missile defense capabilities its allies across the region why shouldn't Trump go
 further he has a nuclear weapon He can threaten Iran based on Trump's logic on
 uh Scott's logic and he can have the keys to Tehran He can go as far as he
 wants and then that's what the neocons want So I don't see it that as acceptable
 First of all the Iranians would never allow their sovereignty to be taken away from them It's part of their
 religious culture It's part of their identity Anyone who knows about Imam
 Hussein and Kabala the grandson of the prophet Anyone who knows how when the
 the the despot of his time of his era wanted him to submit he
 said meaning never to humiliation That is that is a key part of our
 Muslim Iranian uh Shia identity Every year for those who know
 you know when they commemorate Ashur and the march with them of the grandson of
 the prophet it's it's a slogan that people are chant they regularly chant in
 the religious ceremonies and so on So it's ideologically uh humiliation is not
 something that they can accept But as I said even if they were to say okay for the sake of humanity we
 will let's say relinquish a part of our sovereignty let's say hypothetically with who who are you
 going to trust here you give up your sovereignty which is not just your sovereignty but it's your uh it's your
 it's your insurance policy And you're going to put your faith in
 Trump You're going to put your faith faith in the United States which is busy carrying out a holocaust in Gaza which
 is bombing Yemen And since it cannot bomb their and destroy their military targets they're destroying the public
 water reservoirs in Yemen You want to trust the United
 States what fool would do that obama did not abide by his own
 commitments Why would Trump of all people abide by his commitments so there's no one to
 negotiate with in Washington So ideologically speaking
 character-wise it doesn't make sense to us Practically speaking it doesn't make
 sense And it's our it's our insurance policy What it's our defense capability
 If we don't have the ability to defend themselves the neocons would come in
 tomorrow But I don't think the Americans can win that war a conventional war I
 you know Scott Ritter has spoken about nuclear annihilation by basically he's
 saying that the United States is so sinister and so evil which I agree it is utterly sinister and evil because it has
 the same murderous uh culture uh but much more hypocrisy much more hypocrisy
 The west kills and then it they expect you to res to to they expect you to
 thank them and to acknowledge their moral superiority At least Saddam Hussein
 didn't do that At least uh these Zionists and these these Nazis and these
 uh you know death spots across the world and of past weren't so you know weren't
 so arrogant they just killed But anyway
 um if if the United States was to use a nuclear weapon first of all they cannot
 sub they cannot prevent Iran from firing hundreds of thousands of missiles and drones uh from their many underground
 missile and drone bases across the country That's targets across the region
 and especially Iran's drone capabilities Remember the Iranian missiles that were fired at Israel the Israeli regime the
 Israelis couldn't stop them nor could the Americans when the Iranians fired at the them at the
 al-Assad base But Iranian drones I mean they could take out
 everything in the Persian Gulf region and they're hundreds of thousands And it's not they're not you
 know the these these potential targets are not far away They're not hundreds of
 kilometers away Hey they're very close So the Americans they won't be able to stop them That would a war in
 the Persian Gulf would mean the end of the global economy And again this goes back to something that Scott said in one
 of his Twitter tweets that uh well America is self-sufficient No America
 the American consumer is completely dependent on energy cheap energy
 If the price of of oil goes to $500 a
 barrel sure some people are going to get c super rich but the consumer is going
 to be crushed
 Electricity gasoline anything that has to do with energy it will shut
 down businesses factories it will people won't be able to sustain
 themselves anymore It would it would be ruinous for the world and then you'd have tens if not hundreds of millions of
 people on the move If Trump is and his supporters are unhappy about the number
 of as they say illegals or refugees pouring into the United States
 from the southern border imagine what it's going to look like when the global economy collapses And the same is true
 with Europe So it's not a situation that the Americans can
 win and uh the isolation that would come about through a nuclear attack I mean
 that just look right now with the tariffs The world is outraged You see the Chinese and the Japanese and the
 Koreans how they are talking and trying to coordinate with one another These
 three countries have very poor relations with each other But Trump has succeeded to bring them together just like Trump
 has brought Russia and Iran and China together It's bringing it's he's isolating the the the global majority or
 he's isolating the United States from the global majority So a nuclear weapon would totally destroy anything any
 credibility that the United States has Uh I mean it would be the world would
 turn against it uh utterly But um but
 still they would not win So I don't think this is a winnable
 war So and based on logic I don't think there will be a war based on
 logic But uh the United States is not a logical regime The United States is a
 very arrogant emotional angry regime And this is not new It's always been like that It
 sees itself as exceptional and superior to the rest of the world So we can't expect logic and
 reason So that's there's that element too And the Zionists and the United
 States that Zionist lobby they are pushing for war They need war It's not
 good for the Israeli regime war None of these wars have been But Netanyahu and his fanatical
 Zionist supporters All Zionists are fanatical But anyway those very
 fanatical rightwingers with him they they need this war So they will push for
 the war But I think I'm sure that there are many people in the military in the United States who know that the United
 States will not win a war against Iran and they don't want war And that's where things stand So at the moment I think
 the calculation in Thran is that there won't be war but they are preparing for
 they're preparing themselves as if war is inevitable

  I am joined by Professor Muhammad Morandi joining from Tehran.
Professor Morandi, thanks so much again for joining me today.
Thank you very much for inviting me, Danny. It's always a pleasure.

Professor Morandi, my first question to you:
 You know Iran right now is standing very defiant to Trump's war escalation amid all of this liberation day hype. It's not cowtowing to the presence of warplanes and ships that are heading its way, and it's promising reciprocal blows and even the rapid buildup of nuclear weapons development should it be necessary.
Is the US and Israel right now, Professor Morandi, sowing the seeds for their demise? Or is this catastrophic war that's building up going to lead to Iran's ultimate defeat? Professor Morandi, what is your initial impressions of this question?




  I have fought in war since I was 16 as a volunteer. I went and fought on and off few months every year as a volunteer until the war ended six years later. It was an eight-year long war, but the first two years I was too young to volunteer. When I was 16 I volunteered. Since I was still young, I had to give a sort of exam or was interviewed and was allowed to go and fight.

If I could go to Gaza I would go to Gaza. If I could go to Lebanon I'd go to Lebanon. If I could go to Syria I'd go to Syria because if it's something I believe in, I'd fight for it. Of course Yemen the same. But war is horrible - there's no doubt about it. I hate war. If I have to fight a war I'll fight a war, but I hate war. I don't want war.

I believe that the United States would lose a war with Iran. Everyone would lose - the world would lose. War is horrible. The war in Ukraine is a loss for Russia and it's a loss for Ukraine. It's a loss for the West but the loss for Russia is less than the West. That's why Russia's winning relatively speaking - Russia comes out on top. We predicted that from the very beginning - many of us, you yourself, me and some of our friends - but war is still horrible and it's a loss for everyone.

I don't want war to happen, but it's not something that the Islamic Republic of Iran is going to be fearful of. It does not want war, but if it has to confront the United States it will confront the United States.

We've already seen that. Trump sent a letter which had an implicit threat. The Iranians said "No we're not going to negotiate. We're not going to have direct talks." The Iranians said "As usual just as in the past we are prepared to have indirect talks," which we've always had with Trump and with previous administrations.

We've heard over the last couple days in the media that the Trump team is thinking about the Iranian proposal for indirect negotiations. That's not a proposal - the Iranians never proposed that. Iran has said it's willing to continue indirect negotiations - we've already been doing that. So there's nothing new there.

But the very fact that they put it this way and they've said it in the media indicates that it is possible Trump wants an offramp. He wants the opportunity to deescalate at least for now. That may not be true or may be true until tonight when he tweets something new because that's how Trump works. He says one thing, the next day it's something else.




  This whole tariff saga - we've heard different things with Canada, the United States, Mexico. It keeps changing and then suddenly today we got a list that's different or the percentages are different from what they were going to be earlier, and it may evolve again tomorrow. Trump is not a very stable person - he's not stable at all.

If we say he's seeking for an offramp, that means he may be seeking for an offramp today but not necessarily tomorrow. That's one of the reasons why Iran can't negotiate with Trump - we can't trust anything that he says. If he says he'll agree to something today, he may change his mind tomorrow.

Look at what happened in Gaza the day before he came to power. His people negotiated the ceasefire and we were told his representative went and told Netanyahu to sit down and shut up and do as we say. Remember it was on a Saturday and Netanyahu's office supposedly said he cannot meet anyone today and so on, and he was forced to do so.

But then what happened? We were told he's a man of peace who wants to end this holocaust, and then he said Palestinians must leave - the deal that he negotiated, the deal that he is the guarantor. He is saying the Palestinians must leave - that's totally against the deal. And then later on he gives the green light to Netanyahu to restart the mass slaughter of women and children.




  How can we negotiate with Trump? There are two issues here:

Can Trump defeat Iran or will Iran defeat the United States? Will the world lose? What will happen?

War is tragic, but how can we negotiate with this guy? How can we sit down and talk with him when he changes his mind every day?

The United States does that - it's not just him. You saw with the Minsk accords but also the Istanbul negotiations that could have ended the war in Ukraine three years ago. Who pushed Zelensky to quit the talks? It was the previous British prime minister, but who was he speaking on behalf of? It was the United States.

The United States never fulfilled their side of the bargain when they signed the JCPOA under Obama. It wasn't just Trump who tore up the deal - Obama was violating the deal from day one even though Iran was fully committed. But Trump is even worse.

The question is: can we even negotiate? I think the answer to that is at least for now No. There's no one in Washington who you can speak with and be sure that what he says matters or will be carried out.

This is where my friend Scott Ritter and I have a disagreement. We had a Twitter exchange a few days ago - some of our friends probably read them. We had 15-20 tweets that went back and forth. Scott was saying basically that Iran should give up its sovereign right to nuclear program because Trump will destroy Iran.

My response was: first of all, if you accept that logic then even if Iran gives up its nuclear program, its missile defense capabilities, its allies across the region, why shouldn't Trump go further? He has nuclear weapons. He can threaten Iran based on Trump's logic - on Scott's logic - and can have the keys to Tehran. He can go as far as he wants, and that's what the neocons want.

I don't see that as acceptable. First, the Iranians would never allow their sovereignty to be taken away from them. It's part of their religious culture, part of their identity. Anyone who knows about Imam Hussein and Karbala - the grandson of the prophet - knows how when the despot of his era wanted him to submit, he said never to humiliation. That is a key part of our Muslim Iranian Shia identity.




  Every year when they commemorate Ashura and the march of the grandson of the prophet, it's a slogan that people regularly chant in religious ceremonies. So ideologically, humiliation is not something they can accept.

But even if they were to say hypothetically "for the sake of humanity we will relinquish part of our sovereignty" - who are you going to trust here? You give up your sovereignty (which is not just sovereignty but your insurance policy) and you're going to put your faith in Trump? In the United States which is busy carrying out a holocaust in Gaza, which is bombing Yemen?

Since they cannot bomb and destroy their military targets, they're destroying the public water reservoirs in Yemen. You want to trust the United States? What fool would do that? Obama did not abide by his own commitments - why would Trump of all people abide by his commitments?

There's no one to negotiate with in Washington. Ideologically speaking, character-wise it doesn't make sense to us. Practically speaking it doesn't make sense. And it's our insurance policy - our defense capability. If we don't have the ability to defend ourselves, the neocons would come in tomorrow.

But I don't think the Americans can win that war - a conventional war. Scott Ritter has spoken about nuclear annihilation, basically saying the United States is so sinister and evil (which I agree - it is utterly sinister and evil because it has the same murderous culture but much more hypocrisy).

The West kills and then expects you to thank them and acknowledge their moral superiority. At least Saddam Hussein didn't do that. At least these Zionists and Nazis and death squads across the world of past weren't so arrogant - they just killed.




  If the United States was to use a nuclear weapon - first of all they cannot prevent Iran from firing hundreds of thousands of missiles and drones from their many underground missile and drone bases across the country at targets across the region.

Remember the Iranian missiles that were fired at Israel - the Israelis couldn't stop them, nor could the Americans when the Iranians fired at the al-Assad base. Iranian drones could take out everything in the Persian Gulf region, and there are hundreds of thousands of them. These potential targets are not far away - they're very close.

The Americans won't be able to stop them. A war in the Persian Gulf would mean the end of the global economy. This goes back to something Scott said in one of his tweets - that America is self-sufficient. No - the American consumer is completely dependent on cheap energy.

If the price of oil goes to $500 a barrel, sure some people are going to get super rich but the consumer is going to be crushed. Electricity, gasoline, anything that has to do with energy - it will shut down businesses, factories. People won't be able to sustain themselves anymore. It would be ruinous for the world, and then you'd have tens if not hundreds of millions of people on the move.

If Trump and his supporters are unhappy about the number of "illegals" or refugees pouring into the United States from the southern border, imagine what it's going to look like when the global economy collapses. The same is true with Europe.




  It's not a situation that the Americans can win. The isolation that would come about through a nuclear attack - just look right now with the tariffs. The world is outraged. You see the Chinese and the Japanese and the Koreans how they are talking and trying to coordinate with one another. These three countries have very poor relations with each other, but Trump has succeeded in bringing them together - just like Trump has brought Russia and Iran and China together.

He's isolating the United States from the global majority. A nuclear weapon would totally destroy any credibility that the United States has. The world would turn against it utterly. But still, they would not win.

I don't think this is a winnable war. Based on logic, I don't think there will be a war. But the United States is not a logical regime - it's a very arrogant, emotional, angry regime. This is not new - it's always been like that. It sees itself as exceptional and superior to the rest of the world, so we can't expect logic and reason.

The Zionists and the Zionist lobby in the United States are pushing for war. They need war. It's not good for the Israeli regime - none of these wars have been - but Netanyahu and his fanatical Zionist supporters (all Zionists are fanatical, but these very fanatical right-wingers with him) need this war.

I'm sure there are many people in the U.S. military who know the United States will not win a war against Iran and they don't want war. That's where things stand. At the moment, I think the calculation in Tehran is that there won't be war, but they are preparing themselves as if war is inevitable.

<h1>Interview with Professor Muhammad Morandi from Tehran, Iran</h1>
<h2>April, 4th, 2025</h2>
<div class="article-section">
<h2>Iran's Defiance Against US Escalation</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">1. Introduction and Context</span><br>
I am joined by Professor Muhammad Morandi joining from Tehran. Professor Morandi, thanks so much again for joining me today. Thank you very much for inviting me. It's always a pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">2. Iran's Stance on US Threats</span><br>
Professor Morandi, my first question to you: You know Iran right now is standing very defiant to Trump's war escalation amid all of this liberation day hype. It's not cowtowing to the presence of warplanes and ships that are heading its way, and it's promising reciprocal blows and even the rapid buildup of nuclear weapons development should it be necessary. Is the US and Israel right now, Professor Morandi, sowing the seeds for their demise? Or is this catastrophic war that's building up going to lead to Iran's ultimate defeat? Professor Morandi, what is your initial impressions of this question?</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Personal Experience with War</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">3. Professor Morandi's Military Background</span><br>
I have fought in war since I was 16 as a volunteer. I went and fought on and off few months every year as a volunteer until the war ended six years later. It was an eight-year long war, but the first two years I was too young to volunteer. When I was 16 I volunteered. Since I was still young, I had to give a sort of exam or was interviewed and was allowed to go and fight.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">4. Willingness to Fight for Beliefs</span><br>
If I could go to Gaza I would go to Gaza. If I could go to Lebanon I'd go to Lebanon. If I could go to Syria I'd go to Syria because if it's something I believe in, I'd fight for it. Of course Yemen the same. But war is horrible - there's no doubt about it. I hate war. If I have to fight a war I'll fight a war, but I hate war. I don't want war.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Assessment of Potential US-Iran War</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">5. Consequences of US-Iran Conflict</span><br>
I believe that the United States would lose a war with Iran. Everyone would lose - the world would lose. War is horrible. The war in Ukraine is a loss for Russia and it's a loss for Ukraine. It's a loss for the West but the loss for Russia is less than the West. That's why Russia's winning relatively speaking - Russia comes out on top. We predicted that from the very beginning - many of us, you yourself, me and some of our friends - but war is still horrible and it's a loss for everyone.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">6. Iran's Preparedness Against US Threats</span><br>
I don't want war to happen, but it's not something that the Islamic Republic of Iran is going to be fearful of. It does not want war, but if it has to confront the United States it will confront the United States.</p>

<h2>Trump's Unpredictability and Negotiations</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">7. Iran's Position on US Negotiations</span><br>
We've already seen that. Trump sent a letter which had an implicit threat. The Iranians said "No we're not going to negotiate. We're not going to have direct talks." The Iranians said "As usual just as in the past we are prepared to have indirect talks," which we've always had with Trump and with previous administrations.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">8. Trump's Potential Offramp</span><br>
We've heard over the last couple days in the media that the Trump team is thinking about the Iranian proposal for indirect negotiations. That's not a proposal - the Iranians never proposed that. Iran has said it's willing to continue indirect negotiations - we've already been doing that. So there's nothing new there.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">9. Trump's Instability in Policy Making</span><br>
But the very fact that they put it this way and they've said it in the media indicates that it is possible Trump wants an offramp. He wants the opportunity to deescalate at least for now. That may not be true or may be true until tonight when he tweets something new because that's how Trump works. He says one thing, the next day it's something else.</p>

<h2>Trump's Unreliability in Diplomacy</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">10. Example of Tariff Instability</span><br>
This whole tariff saga - we've heard different things with Canada, the United States, Mexico. It keeps changing and then suddenly today we got a list that's different or the percentages are different from what they were going to be earlier, and it may evolve again tomorrow. Trump is not a very stable person - he's not stable at all.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">11. Iran's Distrust of US Commitments</span><br>
If we say he's seeking for an offramp, that means he may be seeking for an offramp today but not necessarily tomorrow. That's one of the reasons why Iran can't negotiate with Trump - we can't trust anything that he says. If he says he'll agree to something today, he may change his mind tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">12. Example of Gaza Ceasefire Reversal</span><br>
Look at what happened in Gaza the day before he came to power. His people negotiated the ceasefire and we were told his representative went and told Netanyahu to sit down and shut up and do as we say. Remember it was on a Saturday and Netanyahu's office supposedly said he cannot meet anyone today and so on, and he was forced to do so.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">13. US Inconsistency in Policy</span><br>
But then what happened? We were told he's a man of peace who wants to end this holocaust, and then he said Palestinians must leave - the deal that he negotiated, the deal that he is the guarantor. He is saying the Palestinians must leave - that's totally against the deal. And then later on he gives the green light to Netanyahu to restart the mass slaughter of women and children.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Fundamental Issues with US Negotiations</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">14. Core Problems in Dealing with Trump</span><br>
How can we negotiate with Trump? There are two issues here: Can Trump defeat Iran or will Iran defeat the United States? Will the world lose? What will happen? War is tragic, but how can we negotiate with this guy? How can we sit down and talk with him when he changes his mind every day?</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">15. Historical US Untrustworthiness</span><br>
The United States does that - it's not just him. You saw with the Minsk accords but also the Istanbul negotiations that could have ended the war in Ukraine three years ago. Who pushed Zelensky to quit the talks? It was the previous British prime minister, but who was he speaking on behalf of? It was the United States.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">16. JCPOA Violations by US</span><br>
The United States never fulfilled their side of the bargain when they signed the JCPOA under Obama. It wasn't just Trump who tore up the deal - Obama was violating the deal from day one even though Iran was fully committed. But Trump is even worse.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Sovereignty and Nuclear Program Debate</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">17. Possibility of Negotiations with US</span><br>
The question is: can we even negotiate? I think the answer to that is at least for now No. There's no one in Washington who you can speak with and be sure that what he says matters or will be carried out.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">18. Disagreement with Scott Ritter</span><br>
This is where my friend Scott Ritter and I have a disagreement. We had a Twitter exchange a few days ago - some of our friends probably read them. We had 15-20 tweets that went back and forth. Scott was saying basically that Iran should give up its sovereign right to nuclear program because Trump will destroy Iran.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">19. Iran's Sovereign Rights</span><br>
My response was: first of all, if you accept that logic then even if Iran gives up its nuclear program, its missile defense capabilities, its allies across the region, why shouldn't Trump go further? He has nuclear weapons. He can threaten Iran based on Trump's logic - on Scott's logic - and can have the keys to Tehran. He can go as far as he wants, and that's what the neocons want.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">20. Cultural Rejection of Humiliation</span><br>
I don't see that as acceptable. First, the Iranians would never allow their sovereignty to be taken away from them. It's part of their religious culture, part of their identity. Anyone who knows about Imam Hussein and Karbala - the grandson of the prophet - knows how when the despot of his era wanted him to submit, he said never to humiliation. That is a key part of our Muslim Iranian Shia identity.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Ideological and Practical Considerations</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">21. Ashura and Cultural Identity</span><br>
Every year when they commemorate Ashura and the march of the grandson of the prophet, it's a slogan that people regularly chant in religious ceremonies. So ideologically, humiliation is not something they can accept.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">22. Trust in US Commitments</span><br>
But even if they were to say hypothetically "for the sake of humanity we will relinquish part of our sovereignty" - who are you going to trust here? You give up your sovereignty (which is not just sovereignty but your insurance policy) and you're going to put your faith in Trump? In the United States which is busy carrying out a holocaust in Gaza, which is bombing Yemen?</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">23. US Actions in Yemen</span><br>
Since they cannot bomb and destroy their military targets, they're destroying the public water reservoirs in Yemen. You want to trust the United States? What fool would do that? Obama did not abide by his own commitments - why would Trump of all people abide by his commitments?</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">24. Practical Defense Considerations</span><br>
There's no one to negotiate with in Washington. Ideologically speaking, character-wise it doesn't make sense to us. Practically speaking it doesn't make sense. And it's our insurance policy - our defense capability. If we don't have the ability to defend ourselves, the neocons would come in tomorrow.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Military Capabilities and Deterrence</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">25. Assessment of US Military Threat</span><br>
But I don't think the Americans can win that war - a conventional war. Scott Ritter has spoken about nuclear annihilation, basically saying the United States is so sinister and evil (which I agree - it is utterly sinister and evil because it has the same murderous culture but much more hypocrisy).</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">26. Western Hypocrisy in Warfare</span><br>
The West kills and then expects you to thank them and acknowledge their moral superiority. At least Saddam Hussein didn't do that. At least these Zionists and Nazis and death squads across the world of past weren't so arrogant - they just killed.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">27. Iran's Missile and Drone Capabilities</span><br>
If the United States was to use a nuclear weapon - first of all they cannot prevent Iran from firing hundreds of thousands of missiles and drones from their many underground missile and drone bases across the country at targets across the region.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">28. Effectiveness of Iranian Weapons</span><br>
Remember the Iranian missiles that were fired at Israel - the Israelis couldn't stop them, nor could the Americans when the Iranians fired at the al-Assad base. Iranian drones could take out everything in the Persian Gulf region, and there are hundreds of thousands of them. These potential targets are not far away - they're very close.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Global Economic Consequences</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">29. Impact on Global Economy</span><br>
The Americans won't be able to stop them. A war in the Persian Gulf would mean the end of the global economy. This goes back to something Scott said in one of his tweets - that America is self-sufficient. No - the American consumer is completely dependent on cheap energy.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">30. Potential Oil Price Shock</span><br>
If the price of oil goes to $500 a barrel, sure some people are going to get super rich but the consumer is going to be crushed. Electricity, gasoline, anything that has to do with energy - it will shut down businesses, factories. People won't be able to sustain themselves anymore. It would be ruinous for the world, and then you'd have tens if not hundreds of millions of people on the move.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">31. Migration Consequences</span><br>
If Trump and his supporters are unhappy about the number of "illegals" or refugees pouring into the United States from the southern border, imagine what it's going to look like when the global economy collapses. The same is true with Europe.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Geopolitical Isolation of US</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">32. US Global Isolation</span><br>
It's not a situation that the Americans can win. The isolation that would come about through a nuclear attack - just look right now with the tariffs. The world is outraged. You see the Chinese and the Japanese and the Koreans how they are talking and trying to coordinate with one another. These three countries have very poor relations with each other, but Trump has succeeded in bringing them together - just like Trump has brought Russia and Iran and China together.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">33. Nuclear Use Consequences</span><br>
He's isolating the United States from the global majority. A nuclear weapon would totally destroy any credibility that the United States has. The world would turn against it utterly. But still, they would not win.</p>
</div>

<div class="article-section">
<h2>Conclusion: War Probability Assessment</h2>
<p><span class="subtitle">34. Assessment of War Likelihood</span><br>
I don't think this is a winnable war. Based on logic, I don't think there will be a war. But the United States is not a logical regime - it's a very arrogant, emotional, angry regime. This is not new - it's always been like that. It sees itself as exceptional and superior to the rest of the world, so we can't expect logic and reason.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">35. Zionist Influence on US Policy</span><br>
The Zionists and the Zionist lobby in the United States are pushing for war. They need war. It's not good for the Israeli regime - none of these wars have been - but Netanyahu and his fanatical Zionist supporters (all Zionists are fanatical, but these very fanatical right-wingers with him) need this war.</p>

<p><span class="subtitle">36. Final Assessment and Iran's Preparedness</span><br>
I'm sure there are many people in the U.S. military who know the United States will not win a war against Iran and they don't want war. That's where things stand. At the moment, I think the calculation in Tehran is that there won't be war, but they are preparing themselves as if war is inevitable.</p>
