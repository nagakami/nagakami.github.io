<h1>プーチン大統領の発言, ４月２１日</h1>

<h4>イースター休戦と敵対行為再開の評価</h4>
<p>
イースター休戦は終了し、敵対行為が再開されました。当初から我々は停戦を前向きに捉えており、それが停戦を提案した理由です。特にイースターは、カトリック教徒、プロテスタント教徒、正教会を問わず、すべてのキリスト教徒にとって重要な祝日であるためです。我々は常に平和的な取り組みを支持しており、キエフ政権の代表者にも同様の対応を期待していました。当初、彼らの反応は否定的で、我々の提案は人々の命を危険にさらすものだと示唆していました。しかし、おそらく外国の担当者の助言を受けて、彼らはそのような取り組みを拒否することは不利な立場になることを認識し、速やかに停戦に同意したようです。

<p>
現在、キエフ政権は主導権を握ろうとしており、ウクライナとウクライナの停戦拡大を協議している。時間と範囲について、これらの提案を慎重に検討し、評価する必要があります。当初から申し上げたように、イースター休戦の経験と成果を評価します。全体として、敵の戦闘活動は減少しており、これは我々の指揮官たちも確認しています。しかしながら、6件の攻撃、固定翼無人機による攻撃90件、約400件の砲撃を含む、約5,000件の違反行為がありました。それでもなお、活動の減少は明らかであり、我々はこれを歓迎し、これを基盤として前進していく用意があります。 </p>

<h4>民間施設と軍事施設の標的</h4>
<p>
民間インフラへの攻撃を行わないという提案については、慎重な検討が必要です。例えば、我が国の軍はスヌミ大学の会議場を攻撃しました。そこは民間施設でしたが、クルスク地域での犯罪に関与した個人を表彰する式典が行われていました。ウクライナ軍と民族主義者の双方が出席していました。彼らは国境地帯での行為に対し、報復に値する犯罪者だと我々は考えています。この攻撃は、これらの犯罪に対する懲罰を目的としていました。これは民間施設なのでしょうか？それともそうでないのでしょうか？政権はしばしば民間施設を軍事目的で利用しています。
</p>
<p>
もう一つの例は最近、オデッサ地域で発生しました。我が国の軍は、新型ミサイルシステムの製造と試験に使用されていた農業施設を攻撃しました。この施設は厳密には民間施設でしたが、軍事目的で使用されていました。同様に、重大犯罪の責任者がレストランなどの民間施設で集まることもあり、それが正当な軍事標的となることがあります。これらすべては徹底的な調査を必要としており、場合によっては二国間対話も必要となるでしょう。私たちはこれらの状況を分析し、将来に向けて適切な決定を下します。

<h4>教皇への哀悼</h4>
<p>
バチカンから悲しい知らせが届きました。教皇が逝去されました。私は教皇と何度か個人的に面会し、様々なルートを通じて連絡を取り合っていました。教皇はロシアに対して非常に好意的な姿勢を持っており、それは間違いありません。正教会では、復活祭の時期に主が誰かを召命することは、その人が良い人生を送り、他の人々のために多くの善行を行ったことの特別な兆候であると信じられています。これは、教皇が信徒だけでなく世界全体のために多大な貢献をされたことにも当てはまると思います。私たちはキリスト教世界全体、特にカトリック教徒の皆様に、心からお悔やみ申し上げます。 </p>

<h4>欧州当局者と5月9日</h4>
<p>
5月9日にモスクワを訪れる予定の指導者たちを脅迫する欧州当局者についてですが、脅迫にはそれを実行する手段と意志の両方が必要です。これらの当局者にそのような能力があるでしょうか？彼らの背後にいる国々が限られた潜在能力しか持たず、ウクライナ人が最後の一人になるまで戦争を続けるよう呼びかけているのであれば、彼らの誠実さと判断力に疑問を抱かざるを得ません。ロシアに来ることを計画している人々は、他人の陰に隠れて脅迫する人々よりもはるかに勇気を示していると私は信じています。何よりも、ナチズムと闘って命を捧げた人々の歴史的功績を称えようとする人々は、尊敬に値します。

    <h1>Assessment of the Easter Truce and Related Events</h1>

    <h4>Assessment of the Easter Truce and Resumption of Hostilities</h4>
    <p>
        The Easter truce has ended, and hostilities have resumed. From the outset, we viewed the ceasefire positively, which is why we proposed it, especially since Easter is a significant holiday for all Christians—Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox alike. We always support peaceful initiatives and hoped that representatives of the Kyiv regime would do the same. Initially, their reaction was dismissive, suggesting our proposal was playing with people's lives. However, it appears that, likely under the advice of foreign handlers, they realized rejecting such initiatives would be a losing position and quickly agreed to the truce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, the Kyiv regime is attempting to seize the initiative, discussing expanding the truce in both time and scope. We must carefully consider and assess these proposals. As I stated from the beginning, we would evaluate the experience and results of the Easter truce. Overall, there has been a decrease in combat activity by the enemy, as confirmed by our commanders. Nevertheless, there were nearly 5,000 violations, including six attacks, ninety attempts by fixed-wing UAVs, and approximately 400 artillery shellings. Despite this, the reduction in activity is evident, which we welcome and are prepared to build upon.
    </p>

    <h4>Civilian and Military Targets</h4>
    <p>
        Regarding proposals not to strike civilian infrastructure, this requires careful examination. For example, our armed forces struck the congress center at Sunumi University, which, while a civilian facility, was hosting an award ceremony for individuals involved in crimes in the Kursk region. Both Ukrainian armed forces and nationalists were present—individuals we consider criminals deserving retribution for their actions in the border area. The strike was intended as punishment for those crimes. Is this a civilian object or not? The regime often uses civilian facilities for military purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another example occurred recently in the Odesa region, where our forces targeted an agricultural facility that was being used to produce and test a new missile system. While the site was technically civilian, it served military functions. Similarly, gatherings of those responsible for serious crimes sometimes occur in restaurants or other civilian venues, which then become legitimate military targets. All of this warrants thorough investigation, possibly even on a bilateral basis through dialogue. We will analyze these situations and make appropriate decisions for the future.
    </p>

    <h4>Condolences for the Pope</h4>
    <p>
        Sorrowful news has come from the Vatican: the Pope has passed away. I met with him personally on several occasions, and we maintained contact through various channels. He had an extremely positive attitude toward Russia, which I can say with certainty. Among Orthodox Christians, there is a belief that if the Lord calls someone during the Easter days, it is a special sign that the person lived a good life and did much good for others. I believe this applies to the Pope, who did a great deal not only for his flock but for the world as a whole. We extend our deepest condolences to the entire Christian world, and especially to Catholics.
    </p>

    <h4>European Officials and May 9th</h4>
    <p>
        Regarding European officials threatening leaders who plan to come to Moscow on May 9th, issuing threats requires both the means and the will to carry them out. Do these officials possess such capabilities? If the countries behind them have limited potential and are calling to continue the war until the last Ukrainian, one must question their sincerity and judgment. I believe those planning to come to Russia demonstrate far more courage than those who hide behind others and issue threats. Above all, those who intend to honor the historical achievements of those who gave their lives fighting Nazism deserve respect.

<!--
vladimir Vladimirovich has the Easter
truce ended how would you assess it and
what is the current status have
hostilities resumed after its
conclusion hostilities have resumed we
said this from the very beginning when
we announced the truce we always view
ceasefires positively which is why we
came forward with such an initiative all
the more so because we are talking about
the bright days of Easter it is a
holiday for all Christians it so
happened that during these days it is
celebrated by Catholics Protestants and
Orthodox Christians therefore we have
always said that we regard any peaceful
initiatives positively we hope that
representatives of the Kiev regime will
treat it the same way although we saw
the initial reaction I think everyone
noticed it a statement was published
according to which our proposal was
viewed as playing with people's fates
lives and so on but apparently someone
smarter was found there who gave them a
hint most likely foreign handlers that
rejecting such initiatives is a losing
position for the Kev regime and they
quickly agreed right now we see that the
K regime is trying to seize the
initiative and talk about expanding the
scope both in terms of time and in terms
of
targets but we must think it over of
course and carefully assess everything
look at the results i if you noticed
said from the very beginning when I met
with the chief of the general staff that
we would see what kind of experience the
announcement of the Easter truce would
bring what does this tell us overall
overall we are observing a decrease in
combat activity on the part of the enemy
that is true these are the assessments
including those of the commanders of our
groupings
nevertheless there were almost 5,000
violations
4,900 among them were six attacks and 90
attempts of strikes by fixedwing UAVs
and I believe 400 artillery
shellings but overall there was indeed a
reduction in activity we welcome this
and are ready to look toward the
future as for the proposal not to strike
civilian infrastructure targets that
needs to be looked
into well for example everyone is well
aware of the strike by our armed forces
on the congress center I believe of
Sunumi University is that a civilian
object or not it's a civilian one
but an award ceremony was taking place
there for those who committed crimes in
the Kursk region both units of the armed
forces of Ukraine and
nationalists and these are the people we
consider criminals who must receive
deserved retribution for what they did
in the border area including in the
Kursk region and they did receive that
retribution it was done precisely in
order to punish them is that a civilian
object or not but the regime uses these
civilian objects or take a recent
example just a few days ago in the Odiza
region a strike was carried out by our
armed forces it was a small settlement
in the Odiza region 82 km I believe from
Odiza and what kind of object was that
an agricultural facility hangers of an
agricultural enterprise but the key of
authorities together with foreign
handlers and assistants organized or
tried to organize not only the
production but also the testing of a new
missile system there that is where the
strike was delivered so is that a
civilian object or not civilian but it
was being used for military purposes or
they hold some sort of gatherings in a
restaurant somewhere those people who
deserve the most serious punishment for
the crimes they have committed in
restaurants meetings gatherings
conferences are held they celebrate
something there drink vodka and so on
one of the strikes was delivered there
as well is that a civilian object
civilian but what is the target a
military one all of this is a subject
for thorough investigation perhaps even
on a bilateral basis as a result of
dialogue we do not rule that out so we
will analyze all of this and make
appropriate decisions for the future
sorrowful news is coming from the
Vatican the Pope has passed away you met
with him repeatedly you respected each
other he put forward various initiatives
can you recall although you have already
sent a telegram of condolences but can
you once again say a few words about
this man about the pontiff you are right
this is a man who had an extremely
positive attitude toward Russia that I
can say with certainty we met personally
on multiple occasions and maintained
contact through various channels this is
a man I want to emphasize once again who
had an extremely positive attitude
toward Russia we will remember
that the fact that the pope passed away
precisely during the Easter days i don't
know how it is for Catholics but among
Orthodox people there is such an
understanding there is an internal kind
of tradition a traditional belief that
if the Lord calls a person to himself
during the Easter days it is a special
sign that the person did not live in
vain did a lot of good for others and
the Lord calls him to himself during
these festive Easter
days i believe that's exactly what
happened i mean that the pope did a
great deal not only for his flock but
for the world as a whole we extend our
deepest condolences to the entire
Christian world and above all of course
to Catholics vladimir Vladimir what is
your view on the fact that European
officials are already threatening
European leaders over their plans to
come to Moscow on May 9th
in order to issue threats one must have
the necessary instruments to carry out
those threats that's the first thing and
second one must be prepared to use those
forces and means in order to make them
real do some European officials have all
of that i don't know
if the potential of the countries
standing behind them is limited to a
million
1,300,000 people and they are calling to
continue the war until the last
Ukrainian then questions arise whether
this is sincere and whether these people
are in their right mind when they
propose something like
that but I think that those who are
planning to come to Russia have much
more courage than those who hide behind
someone else's back and try to threaten
anyone above all in this case those who
intend to honor the historical
achievements of people who gave their
lives in the fight against Nazism
